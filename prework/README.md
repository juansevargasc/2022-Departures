# Prework
The prework here is the process of translating two CSV files, 
one to a PostgreSQL database and the other into a JSON file that contains the columns as 
Python dictionary would.

The idea is to provide two different sources other than CSV files to the main project and 
simulate an ETL pipeline use case.
